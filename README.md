# CodeCraft

The goal of this project is to create a web editor that allows users to build HTML, CSS, and JS code through a simple and intuitive visual interface. The user will be able to create code by building boxes on the UI, and these boxes will automatically generate the corresponding code in the background. The user can then transfer this code to a framework of their choice, such as React, Vue, or Angular.

In addition, the editor will have a feature description text function that allows users to input feature descriptions and have the editor generate the corresponding code. This function will be powered by the ChatGPT API, which uses artificial intelligence to understand natural language and generate appropriate responses.

Overall, this project aims to make web development more accessible to users who may not have extensive coding experience by providing an intuitive visual interface and a simple feature description text function.
